# What is This Website?
This website is a compendium of items from video games that have been implemented as random drops. 
The website is intended to make understanding your drop rates clear through interactive visualisation of these problems with the use of statistical modelling. 
If instead of blindly grinding, you want to know your chances of obtaining items, the data here will be useful to you.

It lists two types; the first type includes all items that have a fixed chance for one or more to drop, as well as a fixed chance for none to drop (they may not drop at all). 
The second type includes all items which may be dropped multiple times, but for which the quantity of items that actually drop is assigned to random chance. 
For these second-type items, each quantity has its own chance, but at least one is always guaranteed to drop.

# Why did I Create This Website?
Multiple reasons apply here. 

Initially, I was extremely annoyed while trying to get a trident in Minecraft because all wikis just stated the basic drop-rate.
Most importantly, I am passionate about creating cool stuff, like a really dynamic and beautifully designed website.
The word "cool" here also applies to the mathematics and statistics behind the website.

I find that interesting, and I think everyone should too (or at least appreciate it; maths gets too much hate societally).
The broader reason is that I like to create hands-on projects that accelerate my learning through experience. 
I learned about these distributions in my studies, so I thought it would be enriching to create a project directly using the concepts.
The possibility of potentially monetising the website with non-intrusive ads or other features is a nice bonus.

I am a student, so I just started this as a project to broaden my skillset and put my knowledge to use, with the possibility of monetisation on the side.
While I am studying a field unrelated to web development, I want to go that much further and put in effort beyond just what is expected of me.
